Project Title: Knowledge Recommendation System.
Description: A system that recommends topics to learn based on prerequisites relationships between topics – just like a roadmap builder for programming, data science, or university courses. Example: “To learn AI -> Learn ML -> Learn Linear Algebra.”
Objectives: 
•	Search for a topic and sees its prerequisites.
•	Mark topics as learned, and system updates what’s learnable next.
•	Multiple paths.
•	Save and load topic graphs.
Concepts to be used:
•	Graph.
•	Queue(BFS).
•	Stack(DFS).
•	Sorting.
•	Adjacency List.
Input	Output
1.    To learn: Deep Learning	1. To learn ‘Deep Learning’, you should follow this path:
Programming Basics -> Data Structures -> Algorithms -> Machine Learning -> Deep Learning.
	
2. Learned : Programming Basics, Data Structures	2.Based on learned Topics{Programming, Data Structures}, you can now learn : [Algorithm]
