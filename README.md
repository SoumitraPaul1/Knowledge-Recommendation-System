_**Project Title**_: Knowledge Recommendation System.


_**Description**_: A system that recommends topics to learn based on prerequisites relationships between topics – just like a roadmap builder for programming, data science, or university courses. _**Example**_: “To learn AI -> Learn ML -> Learn Linear Algebra.”


_**Objectives**:_ 
•	Search for a topic and sees its prerequisites.
•	Mark topics as learned, and system updates what’s learnable next.
•	Multiple paths.
•	Save and load topic graphs.


_**Concepts to be used**:_
•	Graph.
•	Queue(BFS).
•	Stack(DFS).
•	Sorting.
•	Adjacency List.


_**Input && Output**_
1.    To learn: Deep Learning == 1. To learn ‘Deep Learning’, you should follow this path:
Programming Basics -> Data Structures -> Algorithms -> Machine Learning -> Deep Learning.
	
2. Learned : Programming Basics, Data Structures == 2.Based on learned Topics{Programming, Data Structures}, you can now learn : [Algorithm]
